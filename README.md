The TraveLogger application is a mobile app developed using Android Studio that allows users to 
track their location and total steps for any given session. Our goal with this app is to help 
users to track and maintain their fitness level during travelling. The step counter idea is 
inspired by the 10,000 steps a day trend that people do these days.

The application accesses the device’s location, step sensor, and microphone. For each session the 
user starts the application tracks the total steps and location by drawing a polyline on the map 
to track user’s movements. At the end of each session, users can give a title for their session 
and save it to their session history to be viewed later. There are also features where user can 
check their surrounding using the map feature and also the current weather of their location.
